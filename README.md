RoboLiam is a multi-purpose Discord bot that I originally made for my own server, however, I was asked by many people to make the bot public and so I have.

You can test out, report bugs, or make suggestions here! [**RoboLiam Paradise**](https://discord.gg/QFMjF2j).

If you wish to add the bot to your own server, you can do so with the following link: [**Add to your server**](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=694637394300895273&permissions=8&scope=bot)

(The default prefix is ".")
